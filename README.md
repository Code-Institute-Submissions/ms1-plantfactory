## About 
 Plant Factory is a buisness designed at bringing postive change to workplaces in the form of adding more natural elements.  Plant Factory offers both bespoke plant feature building and installant and potted plants/trees of a range of sizes for office place.  Plant factory will visit the buisness in order to asses the sizes needed and if bespoke will design and cater for individual requirements. 
 Plant Factory needed a website to help get new clients and also showcase some of their work.  Plant Factory needed to have contact form so that new and existing clients could reach them easily.   Plant Factory is currently a small company with a small range of website needs,  there is scope for the buisness to grow.  As the buisness grows the website can be adapted to the growing buisness and additional features implamented.

## Designs

### Color -https://mycolor.space/?hex=%232BE67F&sub=1

I have used rich green as my main colour theme for the website. #0b720b this has been paired with an offwhite colour #fdfdfd to ensure good contrast. This will help with Accessibility for visually impaired users. 
This goes with the theme of the website and the buisness.  The buisness moto is making offices greener.  
These colour features several times througout the website which is why I have set a varible in the code.  
I have used the following 

     :root {
    --main-green:#0b720b;
    --off-white:#fdfdfd;
     }
    
This means if the buisness decides at any point to change the key colours they can easily change it in the variable so that they don't need to go through and change every colour individually.
