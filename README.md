## About 
 Plant Factory is a buisness designed at bringing postive change to workplaces in the form of adding more natural elements.  Plant Factory offers both bespoke plant feature building and installant and potted plants/trees of a range of sizes for office place.  Plant factory will visit the buisness in order to asses the sizes needed and if bespoke will design and cater for individual requirements. 
 Plant Factory needed a website to help get new clients and also showcase some of their work.  Plant Factory needed to have contact form so that new and existing clients could reach them easily.
